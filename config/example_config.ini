violating = boolean. True you would like to run `cplex_violating_clustering_lp.py`.
            False if you would like to run `cplex_fair_assignment_lp_solver.py`.
violation = Positive Integer. Violation you would like to use if `violating` is True.
            Suggested is 4 based on experimental results but theoretical guarantee is 
            no higher than 4*Delta + 3. Note that Delta != delta. Delta is the amount
            of overlap between color groups.

# [SECTION]
data_dir = path/to/your/output/directory
dataset = Name of dataset to use. Should exist as a section in config_file.
num_clusters = Number of clusters to use. Either one positive integer value or comma separated list.
deltas = Values of little delta to use. Every value of delta will be run once for every value of num_clusters.
         Can either be single float value or comma separated list.
max_points = Positive integer. If less than number of points in dataset then the dataset will be subsampled
             to this many points.

dataset = bank
num_clusters = 4, 3
